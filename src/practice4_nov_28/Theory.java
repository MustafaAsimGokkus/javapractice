			Class :
			template
			concrete classes / abstract classes / Interface
			Abstract class can have abstract fields and methods
			and constructors, concrete methods
			they cannot allow object creation
			Concrete class can have concrete methods and fields
			cannot have abstraction
			Interface can have abstract methods, final default variable, static method, but cannot have constructors and cannot allow Object creation
			variables, methods, constructors, static block
			primitive and non primitive types
			primitives are in stack memory
			Non-primitives are in the heap memory
			Strings and Objects
			Strings are immutable whereas Objects are mutable
			private => class
			default => package
			protected => same package as well as in the child class of other packages
			public => everywhere
			final variable => no more asignment , cannot update the value
			static variable => access with class name, value common share
			methods :
			method is a function in which we can make code executions
			they have return type or void type
			static methods => cannot be overridden, call by class name
			can be shared
			final method: cannot be overridden
			what is the difference between a method and a costructor?
			Constructor name is the same as class name
			cannot have return types
			can be automatically called when a new object creation is done
			Methods can have different names, have return types and void types.
			static block {} => runs always first.
			when there are multiple object creations from the same class, static block will run once.
			{} => it runs after static block and on top of everything else in class.
			when we have multiple objects, it runs every time there is object creation from the class.
			this :
			this refers to this/current class specificly.
			super :
			super refers to super class and its variables and methods
			this() :
			constructor is called
			super() :
			parent constructor being called
			methods :
			parametrized and non prametrized constructor
			overriding and overloading?
			overriding:
			There has to be inheritance
			it only happends between parent child relationship
			same name
			same signature
			signature means order of parameters, type of parameters or number of parameters.
			overloading :
			should be in the same class
			same name, but different signatures
			final class => cannot be extended
			accessible
			everywhere                method name
			public  static       void main      (String[]args)String ar
				    no object    no return type

		throws Exception
		try catch
		method a(){
			try catch
		}
		method b(){
			a();
		}
		when you use utilities, try catch block is the best option so you do not need to handle exception one more time.
		When we need to handle once the exception, then the best option to use is throws exception.
